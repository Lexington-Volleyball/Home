Volleyball Website Team Description:

Lexington has a large community of volleyball enthusiasts who wish to participate in the sport, and are open to regular opportunities to play it. Currently, there is a group of Chinese-American adults who organize a large weekend volleyball club through WeChat. The club is currently seeking to expand to a wider audience of interested volleyball players. Keeping the organization only on WeChat -  a social media platform mostly used by Asian Americans - is an obstacle to this expansion. The Lexington Youth STEAM Team is building a multiplatform website that enables the weekend volleyball club to be advertised to community members on a wider digital front, while enabling greater technical functionality than a WeChat group. Utilizing Wordpress, MySQL, and PHP, the Volleyball Website team seeks to build a modern website for the association of volleyball players in Lexington, and provide a digital platform for enthusiasts to connect with a larger digital community beyond WeChat. Interested student developers and applicants can reach out to co-leaders William Zhang (aerialconnection98@gmail.com) and Alex Lau (launyte@gmail.com) for more information on the project timeline.
